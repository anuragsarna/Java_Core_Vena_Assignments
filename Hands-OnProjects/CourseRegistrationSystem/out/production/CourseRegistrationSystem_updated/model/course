1.We use linked list instead of list or arraylist because :-
                    1.Not efficient for removal from front as it takes O(n) time cmplexity and linked list takes O(1).
                    2.Built in queue methods like poll,add,offer.
                    3.It is designed for FIFO.

poll() - removal of first element
peek() - seeing the head of the queue
offer() - adding a element in the queue
