Assignment 1: Multi-threaded Logging System

Background:
You're building a high-throughput logging system for a large-scale application.
Logs are generated from various parts of the system and should be stored in the order received,
without blocking the producers.

Requirements:

Part 1: Basic Logging System
Implement a class Logger with the following features:

Method: void log(String message)
Accepts log messages from multiple threads concurrently.
Stores the messages in the order they were received.
Uses a separate thread to flush logs every 5 seconds to the console (simulate disk).

Part 2: Graceful Shutdown
Provide a method void shutdown() that:
Ensures all pending logs are flushed.
Terminates the logging thread cleanly.

Part 3: Stress Simulation
Simulate 100 threads each logging 100 messages.
Ensure that the messages do not get lost or printed out of order.

Bonus Requirements:
Support log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
Add timestamps to log entries
Provide optional file-based flushing instead of console (via configuration)
