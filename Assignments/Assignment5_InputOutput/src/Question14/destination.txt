Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995
and now maintained by Oracle Corporation. Known for its platform independence through the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java enables developers to write code once and run it anywhere.
It is widely used for building enterprise applications, Android apps, web applications, and software tools.
Javaâ€™s strong memory management, robust libraries, and focus on security make it a
reliable choice for scalable and cross-platform development.
